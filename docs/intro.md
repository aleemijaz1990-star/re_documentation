# Relevant Documentation
Relevant Medical System is a sophisticated, multi-client, communication and workflow automation platform designed to enhance patient engagement, optimize marketing spend, and ensure data integrity across various clinical and business systems.
The system operates as a powerful integration and communication layer, linking external Electronic Medical Records (EMR) systems and proprietary client data sources to an automated patient outreach engine.
